        <p>You have come to Empowered Minds the website dedicated to mental health education, awareness, and support. We are a focused specialized non-governmental organization aimed to change the perception towards the mental health and to help people especially teenagers and young adults to take care of it. 
 
            The idea that has been embraced at Empowered Minds is that mental health is as equally significant as physical health. Alas, improvement in this aspect is still felt to be insufficient: many people remain in silence as they continue suffering and facing marginalization, indifference, or simply unwillingness to consult with professionals because of the stigmatized nature of the issue or lack sufficient information and access to mental health care. Our mission is different as we can help to change such perspective and create a supportive, informative, and safe environment on the Internet for people who need information about mental health and where they can receive the necessary help and support. 
            
            <h4>Our Mission:</h4> 
            <br>
            To ascertain our mission it is imperative to assert that our primary aim is to create the social context for happy, mentally healthy individuals to practice. We aim to provide: 
            <br>
            <h4>Awareness:</h4> Articles, videos, and infographics to be created will help the audience become aware of different mental disorders, their manifestation, and ways to address it. It is worth noting that our main aim is to ensure that all the information concerning mental health is availed to the public, and in the process of doing so, it is presented in simple language. 
            <br>
            <h4>Support:</h4>We have a forum where patients can discuss their cases, ask other patients and/or doctors for advice and support. It is a place that will enable the parties to freely discuss any topic and support each other. 
            <br>
            <h4>Resources:</h4> Mental health crisis centers, counseling hotlines, and even online therapy and support groups can all be found on Empowered Minds's list of mental health service. It also provides self-completed questionnaires and guided relaxation for users to empower them on the use of their mental health.</p>
